# CodeRefactor_HW1

## Project Information

I went through the index.html file and updated all the tags to HTML5 semantic tags.
I went into style.css and updated the classes and tags by combining similar elements and removing unnecessary tags in the HTML file.
I added functionality to the links at the top of the page.
I added 'alt' tags to each image.
